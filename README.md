# `reactivemaps-app`

## Installation

- `npm install`
- `npm start` for development server at port 8000
- `npm run build` for production

### Try with bootstrap CSS instead of materialize

```sh
git checkout withbootstrap
npm install
npm start  (open localhost:8080)
```

## Try in browser (without NPM)

If you are new to React and don't want to dig into the NPM based bundling (webpack, browserify, gulp), try this branch.

```sh
git checkout umd
http-server  (open localhost:8080)
```
